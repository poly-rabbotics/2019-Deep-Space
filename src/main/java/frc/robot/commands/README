Commands were not done wrong. However, they were done in always the same way
(for simplicity), even when it was a little bit counterintuitive.

In this program, various parts of the robot are commanded to constantly 
check for input, and do things accordingly. For example, the command tells
arm to keep checking if the drive controller is telling it to move up or
down. So, it does that. About every 20 milliseconds (so 50 times per second),
it checks to see if the drive controller is telling it to go up, and if 
the drive controller is telling it to go up in that exact moment, it does so,
in that exact moment.

So it the command never tells it to go up. Instead, the command tells it to constantly
be determining whether it should go up: Weird, but in this instance, probably 
the best way to operate. (That becomes more questionable with things like
the lift system, which really just can be commanded to extend or retract
instead of being commanded to constantly check if it should extend or retract)


(For the adventurous: I deleted several files that we never used. Feel free to look at
them in the master branch, if you would like to see a confusing but maybe educational
way in which we messed up in the 2019 season.)
