This folder contains wrappers for wrappers. Or, it's supposed to, anyway.

A wrapper is "a class which contains an instance of another class, but which does not
directly expose that instance. The wrapper's main purpose is to provide a 'different' 
way to use wrapped object (perhaps the wrapper provides a simpler interface, or adds 
some functionality)." https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3293752/where-and-how-is-the-term-used-wrapper-in-programming-what-does-it-help-to-do

In other words, a wrapper takes something and just changes the way you interact with it.
The class LogitechF310 is a wrapper because it gives us more readable ways to say the 
same thing. For example, we can say getX(Hand.kRight) instead of 
getRawAxis(4). The first is more readable because you know it gets you a value
for something on an x axis on the left-hand side of the controller, whereas the second
just tells you you're getting information from channel 2 (which actually is the same thing,
but how would you know that?). So that wrapper basically translated from getRawAxis(4)
to getX(Hand.kRight).

So now, we are taking that wrapper, and wrapping it in another wrapper that translates from
getX(Hand.kRight) to a request to turn the robot.


(in reality, we ended up translating directly from getRawAxis(4) to the turn request. Why? I
have no idea.)
