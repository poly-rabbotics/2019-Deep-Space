The person writing this doesn't understand everything, so take the following with a grain of salt:

First, there is a difference between computer vision and just getting a livestream of what cameras
on the robot are seeing. Computer vision is actually analyzing the images with a computer to get 
shapes and find out where they are. THIS IS COMPUTER VISION.

Actually, the computer vision is all done on a chip inside the Pixy camera. We didn't write it.
The files contained by this folder are just using the "something that does something" that another
person made to communicate with the Pixy camera, so that is can tell us what shapes there are and 
where they are.

To the best of my knowledge, we didn't use these files in competition this year, and although it 
would be great for everyone to understand them, it's not first priority.
