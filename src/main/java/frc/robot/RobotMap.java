/**
 * The RobotMap is a mapping from the ports sensors and actuators are wired into
 * to a variable name. This provides flexibility changing wiring, makes checking
 * the wiring easier and significantly reduces the number of magic numbers
 * floating around.
 
 * Postscript: "magic numbers" are hard-coded numbers (fixed values like 8.4 or 220) that are
 * not variables. If you define a variable or a constant called, for example, TICKS_PER_ROTATION,
 * everyone knows what that value is doing. If you just suddenly divide by 220, people won't 
 * realize that you just were dividing by the # of ticks per rotation. Besids, if that number changes,
 * you would have to hunt for that 220 instead of just going to the top of the file where you wrote
 * that TICKS_PER_ROTATION = 220
 * TLDR: Magic numbers are numbers without names, and they are bad!
